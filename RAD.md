I am creating a chrome extension that stops the user from procrastinating by filtering videos out that do not have to do with education while still allowing videos that can help the user learn.

Functional/Non Functional Requirements:
	- I want to be able to:
		○ only watch educational videos on YouTube
			 so I can learn new content
		○ not be able to see videos related not to education
			 so I can not distract myself
		○ turn the filter on and off
			 so I can choose when to use it
		○ set a time limit for the filter
			 so I don't turn it off when I need to work
		○ use it as a google chrome extension
			 so its easily accessible to me and others
