# video-filter
A chrome extension that stops the user from procrastinating by filtering videos out that do not have to do with education while still allowing videos that can help the user learn. Most procrastitation blockers that I have used in the past would block the website I was using, mainly YouTube. That was fine for stopping me from choosing videos that wasted my time, but it would also prevent me from watching tutorials online. I wanted to create an extension that would still allow me to use the education/tutorial side, while preventing me from going off task.
